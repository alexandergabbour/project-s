you've heard of the shortcuts app on apple devices. this will similarly bring together a user-friendly interface and powerful python/bash scripts to make using your machine quicker and more fluid. even the newest of linux users will be able to take advantage of all python and bash have to offer.

## dependencies

- customtkinter
- sqlite3
- subprocess
- Ubuntu font (it's best lol)

*this will eventually be included in a requirements .txt file for quicker dependancy installation

## improvements in development

- dynamic shortcut+function package creation
- ability for shortcuts to reference bash scripts
- additional aesthetic settings
- user definable UI settings
